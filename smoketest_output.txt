📍 Tollgate 1: Permit to Design

We’ll dive into your project’s purpose, outline the necessary features, and ensure we meet all compliance requirements. We’ll also take a close look at infrastructure and workforce costs, plus conduct a gap analysis. Once we’ve got all that sorted out, you’ll be all set to move on to the design phase! Let’s make sure everything’s in tip-top shape before we get started. 😊
