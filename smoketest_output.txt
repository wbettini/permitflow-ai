Great news! We’ll kick things off by capturing your project’s purpose, required features, compliance requirements, infrastructure and workforce costs, and any gap analysis. Once we have all that sorted, you’ll be ready to dive into the design phase. Let’s get this show on the road! 🚀

Just kidding! I got it! So, the purpose is to expedite tollgate approvals for project managers. That’s a fantastic goal! Streamlining those approvals can really help keep projects on track. Let’s dive into the details and see how we can make that happen! 🚀
