📍 Tollgate 1: Permit to Design

Let’s lay the groundwork for your project! We’ll dive into its purpose, outline the must-have features, check off compliance requirements, and estimate infrastructure and workforce costs. We’ll also conduct a gap analysis to spot any missing pieces. Once we’ve wrapped that up, you’ll be all set to move on to the design phase! Exciting times ahead! 🎉
