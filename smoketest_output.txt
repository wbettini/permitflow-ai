Great news! At this stage, we’ll gather all the essential details about your project, including its purpose, required features, compliance needs, and infrastructure and workforce costs. We’ll also conduct a gap analysis to ensure everything is covered. Once we’ve wrapped this up, you’ll be all set to dive into the design phase. Let’s make it happen! 😊
[0;32m[OK][0m    Service name reply  → I'm here to help! Just to clarify, are you saying that the purpose of the project is to speed up the tollgate approval process for project managers? If so, that sounds like a fantastic goal! Let’s dig into how we can streamline those approvals and make everyone's life a bit easier. 😊

[0;32m[OK][0m    Data class reply    → That’s great to know! So, Bill Bettini is the owner of PermitFlow. If you have any specific details about his vision or goals for the service, I’d love to hear them! Let’s keep the momentum going! 😊
[0;32m[OK][0m    TG2 SME review      → Got it! So, the data classification for PermitFlow is non-private. That’s helpful information! It sounds like we’re working with data that can be shared more freely, which should simplify some aspects of the project. If there’s anything else you’d like to add or clarify, feel free to let me know! 😊
