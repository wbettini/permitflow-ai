📍 **Tollgate 1: Permit to Design**  
Great news! We'll start by capturing the project’s purpose, required features, compliance needs, and an overview of infrastructure and workforce costs. We’ll also perform a gap analysis to identify any areas for improvement. Once we’ve dotted all the i's and crossed all the t's, you’ll be ready to dive into the design phase. Let’s get this project rolling!
