📍 **Tollgate 1: Permit to Design**  
Great news! We’ll kick things off by capturing your project’s purpose, the features you need, compliance requirements, and the costs for infrastructure and workforce. Plus, we’ll conduct a gap analysis to ensure everything's in order. Once we’ve got all that sorted, you’ll be ready to dive into the design phase! Let’s make this project a success together!
