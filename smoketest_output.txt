🌟 **Tollgate 1: Permit to Design** 🌟

In this step, we’ll dive into the nitty-gritty of your project! We’ll outline its purpose, necessary features, compliance requirements, and even take a good look at infrastructure and workforce costs. Plus, we’ll identify any gaps that need addressing. Once we’ve wrapped up this analysis, you’ll be all set to move on to the exciting design phase! 

Let’s get this project rolling! 🚀
