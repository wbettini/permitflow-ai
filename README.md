# 🚦 PermitFlow‑AI

**Agentic, multi‑role tollgate approvals — featuring FlowBot orchestration and human‑in‑the‑loop review.**

PermitFlow‑AI is an open‑source framework for orchestrating structured, multi‑stage approval workflows.  
Powered by **FlowBot**, your AI process navigator, it guides applicants step‑by‑step, collects SME (Subject Matter Expert) reviews with justifications, and ensures every outcome gets final human sign‑off — blending automation speed with accountability and transparency.

## ✨ Core Concepts

### **FlowBot — The Navigator**
- Greets and guides applicants through the permit process.
- Dynamically requests missing information.
- Routes applications to the correct SMEs based on permit type.
- Keeps state during the conversation so the process feels continuous.

### **SME Agents**
- Domain‑specific reviewers (e.g., Cybersecurity, Infrastructure, Finance).
- Each SME returns a decision (`approve` / `decline`) and a justification.
- Configurable via `tollgates.yaml` — no code changes required to add/remove SMEs.

### **Human‑in‑the‑Loop**
- Final review stage for accountability.
- Placeholder in the demo; can be integrated with real approval systems.

### **Azure‑Friendly Architecture**
- Stateless FastAPI backend — runs identically in Codespaces and Azure Web Apps.
- WebSocket endpoint for real‑time chat.
- Lightweight HTML/JS front‑end served from `/` for instant browser access.

If you have ideas for new SME agents, UI improvements, or integrations, open an issue or fork the repo.💡 Why PermitFlow‑AI?Most approval workflows are slow, opaque, and siloed.
PermitFlow‑AI makes them:- Transparent — every decision has a justification.
- Efficient — FlowBot collects exactly what’s needed, no more, no less.
- Flexible — easily reconfigure SMEs and required fields without code changes.
- Engaging — real‑time chat makes the process feel human, not bureaucratic.
