"""
config.py â€” Core configuration and defaults for PermitFlow-AI.

Responsibilities:
- Define application-wide constants and default settings.
- Centralize file paths for local JSON-based storage (to be replaced by Azure DB).
- Provide helper functions for loading configuration data.

Future Changes:
- When migrating to Azure DB, replace file path constants with DB connection settings.
- Keep DEFAULTS here so they remain the single source of truth.
