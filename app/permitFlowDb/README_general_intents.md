General Intents and Purpose
The purpose of this directory/repository is to:
- Provide a standardized reference and collection of all general behavioral conventions and intents relevant to the code, data, and documentation collected here.
- Serve as a single source of truth about expected directory structure, naming conventions, and high-level workflow logic.
- Enable downstream collaboration by clearly signaling what users should and should not expect from these files, datasets, or modules.
- Ensure discoverability and resilience by employing portable Markdown, documented file and directory naming conventions, and relative asset links.
Scope:
This file does not contain detailed API documentation, implementation specifics, or exhaustive troubleshooting advice. Instead, it emphasizes project-wide principles, intent, and navigational guidance, and links users to detailed guides where relevant.

Directory Structure
Below is the current directory tree overview for the repository, rendered as a code block for optimal offline Markdown formatting. All referenced files and directories are relative to the location of this README.

Notes:
- All referenced Markdown files (.md or .ms) are navigable by relative path.
- Image assets may be referenced (see Embedding Assets).
- Directory names use lowercase and underscores for consistency. Filename and directory conventions should be followed for ease of automated processing and collaboration.

Getting Started
Minimal prerequisites:
- Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later (if code is present)
- Clone the repository:
git clone https://example.com/project-root.git
cd project-root
- Review the docs/overview.md and docs/usage_guide.md for detailed instructions.
Essential steps:
- Check the directory structure above to orient yourself.
- Refer to src/main.py or equivalent entry points for executable code.
- Raw data can be found under data/raw/; processed output resides in data/processed/.
- Test resources are bundled under tests/.

Usage Guidelines
- Follow all conventions described in this file and in CONTRIBUTING.md.
- File Organization: Place new scripts in src/, documentation in docs/, and dataset samples in data/.
- Naming Conventions: Use lowercase/underscores for files, avoid spaces or special characters, and prefer ISO dates for timestamped assets (YYYY-MM-DD).
- Documentation: All new subdirectories should have a local README.md/README.ms describing their contents and function.
- Asset Linking: Reference resources using relative paths for portability (see Embedding Assets for Offline Use).

Embedding Assets for Offline Use
- Images: To display an image offline, use:
![Data schema diagram](images/schema.png)
- Place all images in the /images directory; ensure relative links are correct.
- Data Samples: Reference dataset samples with inline code or hyperlinked filenames:
See example input: [data/raw/example_input.csv](data/raw/example_input.csv)
- Base64-embedded Images (Advanced):
If the repository demands completely self-contained documentation (i.e., no separate files), an image may be embedded using Base64 encoding and HTML:
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0K..." alt="Embedded Diagram" width="400"/>
- Caution: This increases .ms file size and may not render on all Markdown viewers.

- Directory Trees: Keep directory nesting to a maximum of 3–4 levels where possible for simplicity.
- Maximum Path Length: Limit to 255 characters for full compatibility across platforms.
- Documentation Updates: Update this file with each major repository or structure change.

FAQs and Troubleshooting
Q: How do I ensure my links and images work offline?
A: Always use relative paths (e.g., images/my_image.png), and run Markdown preview in your editor or browser before publishing.

Q: Where can I find detailed implementation or dataset guides?
A: See the docs/ directory. This file is for general intents and structure only.

Q: What if I discover inconsistencies or errors in this documentation?
A: Please submit a pull request or file an issue on the project tracker with a clear description.
